# About

I think the welcome page does a fair job summarizing this site, so I won't go into more depth here.

If you are interested in my professional blog that is solely cybersecurity oriented, I'll leave that link down below. It also outlines some of my projects with raspberry pi's if that's of interest to you.

About me personally, I am currently studying Cybersecurity with a concentration in Wireless and Mobile Security at American Public University, and set to graudate in the fall of 2023. I've earned my CompTIA Security+ certification and am working towards my Network+, CCNA, and Linux+ among others.

Feel free to reach out with any question. Cheers.
