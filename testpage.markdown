Below is how the game first appeared in roughly 2015:

Since then, I have added a hundred other features and abilities, updated the graphics, and the code itself has naturally grown exponentially as a result. What this looks like now:

Where this project is going-
Below is an image of a RaspberyPi running RetroPie and Fire Emblem Sacred Stones. Formerly, I always ran and worked on the game on my laptop running Windows, until it occurred to me - how cool would it be to be able to play my own game that I’ve programmed on a console I‘ve built? Since then I have been (attempting) to migrate all functions of the game into the Linux distribution for the ability to play it on there.

This will take some heavy modifications- everything from the size of the text to how many tiles fit on the screen will have to be adjusted. I am going from a large laptop screen to an actual „console“ sized screen at just 480x320 dimensions. It will take work. The other issue is now trying to use Python v2.7 on that, and when I tried updating the script to v3.x some modules no longer worked correctly nor did some of the sounds load in correctly.
