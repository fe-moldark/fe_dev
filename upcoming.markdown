# Upcoming:
-How the water appears to move in the background, the code behind and the image itself.
<br>
<br>
-How death quotes work for ally characters.
<br>
<br>
-Adding how I make the characters (graphics-wise), along with the .xcf file for you to mess around with if you so choose.
<br>
<br>
-Will also upload the background texture I made in Gimp. It's used for most backgrounds on the preparation phase, in different colors however.
<br>
<br>
-How the enemy attack map works (pressing the 'x' button)
<br>
<br>
-Using items like vulneraries and stat-boosting items (akin to 'dragonshields' or 'speedwings')
<br>
<br>
-Weapons / staves "breaking"
<br>
<br>
-And more...
