# Features



To highlight some of the features to the game, I've compiled some basic screen recordings and uploaded them to a playlist on youtube. Seemed the easiest way to embed them here as well as bring traffic to both sites.

Full playlist: [Fe Moldark - Features](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLecUQNqdK8lTE4pW3j9KHZKFbjVlQEecY)

That playlist highlights around 8-10 different features and explains them pretty well, so I won't go into depth on them again.

That channel has a few other gameplay videos I've uploaded if you want to check them out.
