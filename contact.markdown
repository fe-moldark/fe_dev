If you want to contribute to this game via graphics or anything else, by all means reach out and I can provide information on dimensions of specific images, etc. Same applies to coding - if there is a classic FE feature out there you notice I'm missing, reach out and we can work from there.

Alternatively, if you want to take this project as is and go in your own direction with it just let me know, I won’t have a problem providing the source code I’ve written so far. Fair warning - it sits at over 15,000 lines of code for the main program and a seperate program at around 3,000 lines which is used as an essential creating / structuring tool. Additionally, since this was always a personal project and never meant to be distributed this way, it is NOT well documented. As long as you understand it will be a pain trying to decipher this on your own, go for it. I have variables and functions named things similar to „whyArentYouWorking“ or „IHateThisPart“ which I know VERY well what they are supposed to do, however a stranger will no doubt find them incredibly confusing. This is a very large project that has been 7 years in the making after all, so there's even a fair amount of old code that I can have trouble deciphering.

I am thinking of putting the source code and sample file system up on Github, but that will not be anytime soon. That readme file would probably take an hour to read through and even longer for me to write out.
