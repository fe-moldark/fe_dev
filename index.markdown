Welcome to FE Moldark, a website dedicated to documenting the complete recreation of the Fire Emblem game - everything from the graphics, a custom storyline and the various functions involved. "Fire Emblem - Moldark“ is written entirely in Python v2.7, an old version of Python, yes, however this project began over 7 years ago and has been periodically worked on since. The code is completely original and throughout this site (and my youtube channel) I go into how different parts of it work.

The code currently stands at 15,000 lines of code, a challenge to keep up with for sure. For those familiar with the Fire Emblem series this is because I am attempting to incorporate functions from every aspect of the game; opening doors and chests, healing and warping staffs, limiting movement for some class types but not others, including a convoy screen and adjustable map before going into battle, trading items, armory and vendors, there are a million different aspects already involved and a million more to go. One major accomplishment is the loading screen, sounds simple, I know. I was able to program a way not just to load a chapter and play with those characters, but successively update into save files as well as the ability to save mid-game (think the "suspend" option for those familiar).

On a fundemental level, the tilemap is already setup in a grid and the map is loaded into multiple arrays to display on the screen and to control / limit player movement. Aspects such as creating an intelligent, and dangerous, enemy took a good deal of time, in other words choosing where to move for what reasons, what targets to choose as opposed to others, choosing what weapons to attack with, etc.

Feel free to browse around - I have or am working on multiple pages to showcase the various functions and features of the game, as well as some of the code I have written for it.

There is no graphics team, programming and design team, gameplay and story departments, etc. It’s basically just me tackling them all as best I can on my own, which while it allows me to implement exactly what I want into the game, it also takes a good deal more time.

Enjoy.
